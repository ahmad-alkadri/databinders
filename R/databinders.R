#' @description The aim of databinders is to solve a common problem
#' of mine: the need for
#' binding many datasets containing the experimental data of
#' my many specimens and recapitulating them into a single dataframe.
#' Note that this package was basically written as a wrapper of
#' the well-known \href{https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/rio/}{rio} package,
#' my preferred go-to package for working with many types of data.
